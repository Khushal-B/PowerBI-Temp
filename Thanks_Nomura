Hi Nishant,

I still remember the first time I met youâ€”when you had come to my college to conduct the interviews for Nomura. I was genuinely inspired by you back then and really hoped Iâ€™d get the chance to work with you someday. 
Thankfully, I did! Over the past six months, working at Nomura and closely with you has been a truly impactful experience. The eFXO project, in particular, was one of the best hands-on projects Iâ€™ve worked on,
 and I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of it.Although Iâ€™ve currently chosen to pursue a different path, I sincerely hope I get the opportunity to work with you again in the future.

Warm regards,
Khushal

Hi Mohit,

I still remember the first time I met you at the start of the internshipâ€”I was pretty nervous and unsure of what to expect. I also wasnâ€™t very familiar with the tech stack being used. From that day onwards, 
youâ€™ve always supported me and given me the time and space to get comfortable with everything I needed to know. I really enjoyed the KT sessions you conducted, and I genuinely loved working on the various
 projects like the RODS scripts and eFXO. Itâ€™s hard to believe itâ€™s already been six months since I joined the team. Although Iâ€™ve currently decided to pursue another path, I truly hope i can work with you again
 in future. Itâ€™s been a pleasure working with you!

Warm regards,
Khushal

Hi Shashank,

I still clearly remember the very first day i had meet you at the start of the internship. I was pretty nervious and did not know what to expect next. From that day to the present,
i have come a long way and have got a chance to grow along with this team. You have always been there whenever I was stuck at something and have helped me.  I am greatfull for all of that. 
Althoughly currently i have decided to pursue another path, i really hope that in future, I get a chance to again work with you and the team.  

Hi Ankit,

I still remember our first interactionâ€”when you interviewed me. Itâ€™s hard to believe itâ€™s already been six months since I joined the team. Over this time, Iâ€™ve grown a lot and have been truly inspired by the kind of work the team is doing.
Although I didnâ€™t get many chances to interact with you personally, Iâ€™ve learned a lot from observing your approach and perspective on things. Thatâ€™s been incredibly valuable.
While Iâ€™ve currently chosen to pursue a different path, I sincerely hope I get the chance to work with you again in the future.
Best regards,
Khushal

Hi Vedant,

I still remember the first time I met you during the New Hire Orientation. Iâ€™ll be honestâ€”I was a bit skeptical about you being a good colleague based on your initial vibe. But wow, was I wrong. I couldnâ€™t have asked 
for a better colleagueâ€¦ and a better friend.
Whenever I was stuck, you were always there to help. Iâ€™ve learned so much from you over the past six months. Honestly, itâ€™s hard to believe itâ€™s only been that longâ€”it already feels like Iâ€™ve known you for years.
What Iâ€™ll miss the most after leaving Nomura is you. I really hope we get a chance to work together again in the future. Until then, stay awesome!

Cheers,
Khushal

Subject: Thank You, Legends âœ¨

Hi guys,

Itâ€™s hard to believe itâ€™s already been almost 6 months since we metâ€”and honestly, those 6 months flew by so easily, all thanks to you.
I never expected to make such amazing friends at work, but here we are. Whether I was ranting about something or flexing my absolutely legendary dashboards, you all were always there for itâ€”and for me.
Thanks for everything. I genuinely hope we get to work together again someday (future ke liye abhi se referral mang raha hu... lol ðŸ˜„).
Stay awesome,
Khushal
